\maketitle
Deep learning is a form of graphics-based machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks and high-speed GPU processing to make sense of images, sound and text. The goal of this project is to create an application which uses deep learning to perform a particular task and run on the Jetson TX1 Developer Kit. The application will be utilized as part of a training program to teach users how to solve similar problems with deep learning.
