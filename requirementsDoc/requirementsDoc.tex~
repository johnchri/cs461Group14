\begin{abstract}
Deep learning is a form of graphics-based machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks and high-speed 
GPU processing to make sense of images, sound and text. The goal of this project is to create an application which
 uses deep learning to perform a particular task and run on the Jetson TX1 Developer Kit. The application will be 
utilized as part of a training program to teach users how to solve similar problems with deep learning. NVIDIA's D
eep Learning Institute has a high demand for training in this field of artificial intelligence. This project will 
provide a tool for NVIDIA's training purposes. Because of this the project must also run on their develper kit. Ou
r team will be using version control to work efficiently and keep objectives organized. We will have our repositor
y stored on Git Hub and use issue tracking and status reports to keep track of jobs.

Our team name will be AI Gaming. 

The project will have to be able to run in the Jetson TX1. This will also require extra hardware such as the

The machine will take video input in learning how to play a game. A camera will be needed to retrieve this input. 

The solution of our project will need to be able to beat the game at least 90\% of the time.
