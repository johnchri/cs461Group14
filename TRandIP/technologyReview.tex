\section{Visual Library}
\subsection{Open CV}
An OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library that can be used with tons of different languages(C, C++, Java, Python, etc.).
 It provides standard things such as image capture, Faces recognition, Gesture recognition, Motion tracking, Mobile robotics, Object identification and Image manipulation.
 OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
 Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code (Team).
\subsection{SimpleCV}
SimpleCV is a framework including several libraries and uses Python for scripting.
Due to the nature of python, it can either run scripts or use an interactive shell to do computer vision computation and related tasks.
With it, you get access to several high-powered computer vision libraries such as OpenCV – without having to first learn about bit depths, file formats, color spaces, buffer management, eigenvalues, or matrix versus bitmap storage (Sight Machine, Inc).
\subsection{Community Core Vision}
CCV (Community Core Vision) library is an open source/cross-platform solution for blob tracking with computer vision.
Supports a wide range of camera devices with the ability to stitch and switch in between sensors on the fly.
It is built on C++ for real-time performance and stability using common frameworks including OpenCV and open Frameworks.
To minimize the code base, it gives up non-essential functionalities aggressively.
It is not a library for you to experiment different algorithms.
It is a library for you to use in your applications (LiuLiu, 2012).




\section{Jetson...}

The role of making sure everything runs smoothly on the platform required of us to implement out solution on can be devided into three categories.
These categories are finding the right communication methods with our client for group meetings, deciding on an interface toolkit, and figuring out the best way to visialize the data.
For each of these three tasks I have found three approaches that I have research and given thorough consideration.
This is to ensure that we are making the best possible decisions when working with the Jetson TX1.

There are many very popular and suitable tools available to conduct online meetings.
These include Skype, Discord, and Team Speak.
Skype was founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennström.
Skype has a lot of features that Discord and Team Speak don't have.
One of these features includes screen sharing.
This feature could be very beneficial during group meetings when a group member has to explain something visually.
Our group has used Skype twice in the past and the sound quality was good enough for everyone to understand each other.
Discord and Team Speak also do not allow video calls, they only provide groups to voice and text chat.
One down side with Skype however is the presence of bugs.
Among reviewers, skype is the least reliable.

Discord, which is the most recent VoIP service released, is known for its very nice user interface.
This service also does not require a download.
Users can log on and join a Discord server using their browser.
Discord hosts its own servers which are very reliable.
Call quality is not limited to a group members poor internet.
Discord is also very light weight and puts much less strain on the cpu than Skype and Team Speak.
However, Discord does not have many of the Skype features including video calling and screen sharing.

Team Speak is known for its sound quality.
Team Speak is the second oldest voice chat service, which has been in development since 2004.
