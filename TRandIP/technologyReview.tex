The role of making sure everything runs smoothly on the platform required of us to implement out solution on can be devided into three categories.
These categories are finding the right communication methods with our client for group meetings, deciding on an interface toolkit, and figuring out the best way to visialize the data.
For each of these three tasks I have found three approaches that I have research and given thorough consideration.
This is to ensure that we are making the best possible decisions when working with the Jetson TX1.

There are many very popular and suitable tools available to conduct online meetings.
These include Skype, Discord, and Team Speak.
Skype was founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennstr√∂m.
Skype has a lot of features that Discord and Team Speak don't have.
One of these features includes screen sharing.
This feature could be very beneficial during group meetings when a group member has to explain something visually.
Our group has used Skype twice in the past and the sound quality was good enough for everyone to understand each other.
Discord and Team Speak also do not allow video calls, they only provide groups to voice and text chat.
One down side with Skype however is the presence of bugs.
Among reviewers, skype is the least reliable.

Discord, which is the most recent VoIP service released, is known for its very nice user interface.
This service also does not require a download.
Users can log on and join a Discord server using their browser.
Discord hosts its own servers which are very reliable.
Call quality is not limited to a group members poor internet.
Discord is also very light weight and puts much less strain on the cpu than Skype and Team Speak.
However, Discord does not have many of the Skype features including video calling and screen sharing.

Team Speak is known for its sound quality.
Team Speak is the second oldest voice chat service, which has been in development since 2004.
